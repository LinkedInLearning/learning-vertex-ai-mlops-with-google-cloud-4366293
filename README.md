It seems like everyone is talking about AI these days. But did you know you can train and manage machine learning models using the new MLOps cloud solution from Google? In this course, learn how to manage your entire machine learning model’s lifecycle—from loading data to monitoring deployments—using Vertex AI to build models and maintain your applications.

Find out why Vertex AI has become so popular so quickly, not just within the tech industry, but all across the globe. Instructors Archana Vaidheeswaran and Soham Chatterjee show you the skills you need to know to get up and running with this powerful new tool. Along the way, take your Python and ML skills to the next level with data loading, feature engineering, training models and hyperparameter tuning, model deployment, and model monitoring.



## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
